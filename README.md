# Trivia

This is a code demo I made of a simple trivia quiz showcasing TypeScript and React.

This project uses [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)'s API. Open Trivia Database is a user-contributed trivia question database that provides a JSON API to to retrieve trivia questions.

After being retrieved, trivia questions are presented in a multiple choice fashion. The correct option and incorrect options are shuffled to prevent bias from the source. After selecting an option, you will be informed of the correct answer and then promted to try another question.

## Future Improvements

- Add multiple players.
- Ability to choose category and difficulty of the trivia.
